# DOTFILES

![screenshot](./2023-11-02_04:30:42.png)

Perpetual WIP.

## Where the stuff is

- packages (fonts, scripts, fish plugins, some programs) are available as either an overlay or in the `packages` attribute.
- some useful modules are available in `modules/share/`. No documentation for those though.
- the dotfiles are mostly in `dots`. You can probably get them with the `home` module.

## Highlights

- **mainmenu** - *deprec* like rofi but hip and dmenu, with quick access to programs, configs and math stuff.
- **lilex** - lilex font packaged and patched, to allow building nerd font from sources on any nix machine - select all your favourite ligatures.
- **xmonad** - xmonad.
